sudo gem install bundle

cd android and ios

bundle init

then update gem "rails" to gem "fastlane"

bundle update

bundle exec fastlane produce

bundle exec fastlane init

here we have to do seee the changes and fatlane folder inside ios directory

bundle exec fastlane match init

bundle exec fastlane match appstore

After set uncheck on sigining and setup code signin

xcode clean build -project ProjectName.xcodeproj -configuration Release -scheme ProjectName

IOS->fastfile in fastlance folder for release -> "uncomment" match section
increment_build_number (Above match (type: "appstore"))
below pilot need to add "clean_build_artifacts"
and 
commit_version_bump(
	message: "Fastlance iOS: Release new build #{lane_context[SharedValues::BUILD_NUMBER]} [ci skip]"
	xcodeproj: "./ProjectName.xcodeproj"
	force: true
)
and change on pilot action
pilot(
	skip_watiing_for_building_processing: true
)

from ios project

bundle exec fastlane beta (ryih-qirc-ofqi-iwou)

ICON Generation on IOS and put manually on XCODE

Need to remove Import Compilance Error need to add few line in info.plist file in IOS folder

<key>ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption</key>
<false/>

Cocopods

yarn add react-native-lock and react-native link react-native-lock

add this Pods directory on .gitignore file

ios/Podfile.lock


Now need to set on fastfile inside fastlance

in beta late

change 
cocoapods
gym(
	scheme: "ProjectName",
	workspace: "./ProjectName.xcworkspace"
)


in Gemfile need to add in ios folder

gem "cocoapods"



Android

First need to create project on Google Play then
in Android folder need to do that
command: bundle init
then update gem "rails" to gem "fastlane"
command: bundle update

> bundle exec fastlance init


then neeed to follow the steps https://www.udemy.com/course/automate-your-react-native-releases-with-fastlane-and-bitrise/learn/lecture/7599336#content

generate keystore file as IOS or other

add this block into the android/app/build.gradle file
signingConfigs {
	release {
		storeFile: 'keystore path'
		storePassword: 'storepasswod'
		keyAlias: 'alias'
		keyPassword: 'password we set'
	}
}
and 
buildTypes {
	release {
		..
		..
		signingConfigs signingConfigs.release
	}
}


terminal android project folder

./gradlew assembleRelease


before your first relase need to do manually

need to get api access from the setting in playstore 

create service in api access and create a service 

provide secret account name and role service account acotor

finish a private key -> key type json and create

need to grand access of the service account with release manager access

put the json file into the secure folder with keystore 

need to verify the icon before autmate the build

Now for autobuild for next relase following commands are

bundle exec fastlane supply init
	need to put the json file

in android/fastlane and put the path of secure folder of json file on Appfile json_key_file.

Need to change version number and version code

build exec fastlance add_plugin increment_version_code
y for question

automated added into the Genfile and Pluginfile

add content in Fastfile

desc "Deploy a new alpha version on playstore"
lane :alpha do
	increment_version_code(
		gradle_file_path: "./app/build.gradle"
	)
	gradle(task: "assembleRelease")

	supply(
		trach: "alpha",
		apk: "#{lane_context[SharedValues::GRADLE_APK_OUTPUT_PATH]}"
	)

	git_commit(
		path: "./app/build.gradle"
		message: "Fastlance Android Release new build #{version_code} [ci skip]"
	)
end

bundle exec fastlane alpha


Add Tester in Release management and add tester
